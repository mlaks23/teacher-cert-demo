<h3>Section 4: Connection with My Grandmother, Isabel Blumenfeld</h3>

In 1933 my grandmother was about 17 years old and living in the Bronx.
A friend of hers read that Diego Rivera was painting a mural in Rockefeller Center.
My grandmother and her friend went to see the mural being painted.
Rivera saw her and invited her to come up to the scaffold.
He asked her name and then drew her into the painting.
She told me Frida Kahlo, Rivera's wife and a Japanaese artist, possibly Isamu Nogochi, were there.
Around 2005, I took my grandmother to Rockefeller Center. I spoke with a guard and asked him about the mural.
She described to us where the scaffold was and where the paintings were. The guard said she was correct in her reccollections
