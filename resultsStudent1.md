Responses to the following questions:

#### Why did you choose the board size for your finalized table?

I decided to use the 20 by 20 board size to avoid an excessive runtime and the extreme behavior evident in smaller graphs.

#### Why did you choose the number of repetitions size for your finalized table?

I chose the repetition size of 50 to produce more conclusive results and reduce the impact of outliers on the end result.

#### What did your testing show about changing the board size?

Changing the board size demonstrated a dramatic increase at  after a relatively unchanged number of ticks in the 2903883 to 2890183 interval.

#### Knowing that there were differences based on boardsize, what was the relationship between the board size and the maximum burn time? How did you test this?

The relationship between board size and the maximum burn time is a generally linear increase, demonstrated in all the densities tested (although the lower densities were more prone to exceptions). I tested this by altering an method to find the maximum burn time

#### What density of trees yields the maximum burn time?

While the results test to vary from each trial as depicted in the graphs below, the density that yields the maximum burn time is usually within the 60% to 70% range. In the second Table density 60% and 70% are both twin peaks within the data at a burn time of 40.

#### Two tables include a header that tells the number of repetitions and board size chosen. The size/repetitions can be different
One table from 5% to 95% density in 5% intervals.
The other table from x% to y% density in 1% intervals, where x and y are around the maximum.
